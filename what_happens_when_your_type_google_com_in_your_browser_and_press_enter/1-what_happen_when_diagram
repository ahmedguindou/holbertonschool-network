🌐 Request Flow Diagram: What happens when you type https://www.google.com
📊 Diagram

📝 Step-by-Step Explanation
🔍 DNS Resolution

Browser initiates DNS query for "www.google.com"
Query goes through local cache → OS cache → ISP DNS → Root DNS → TLD DNS → Authoritative DNS
Returns IP address to browser
🔌 TCP Connection & 🛡️ Firewall

Browser initiates TCP connection on port 443 (HTTPS)
Connection must pass through:
Local firewall
Google's firewall
SSL/TLS handshake establishes secure connection
⚖️ Load Balancer

Request reaches Google's load balancer
Load balancer:
Checks server health
Applies load balancing algorithm
Routes to appropriate web server
🌐 Web Server

Receives request
Handles static content
Forwards dynamic content requests to application server
⚡ Application Server

Processes business logic
Generates dynamic content
Manages user sessions
